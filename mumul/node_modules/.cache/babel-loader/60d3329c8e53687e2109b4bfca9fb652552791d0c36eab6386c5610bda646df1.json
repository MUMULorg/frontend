In any case,\r\n        we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the\r\n        processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal\r\n        Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement\r\n        necessary to enter into a contract.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2 id=\"managing-information\">Managing information</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you.\r\n        The Personal Information you can delete may change as the Website and\r\n        Services change.

Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in\r\n        connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to\r\n        collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who use or\r\n        visit a website or online service as they move across different websites\r\n        over time. How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet\r\n        uniform. As a result, the Website and Services are not yet set up to\r\n        interpret or respond to Do Not Track signals communicated by your\r\n        browser.
